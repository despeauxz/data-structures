#### Understanding Big O Notation
Big O notation is a particular tool for assessing algorithm efficiency. Big O notation is often used to show how programs need resources relative to their input size. Big O notation is also known as Bachmannâ€“Landau notation after its discoverers, or asymptotic notation. "Big" means "capital" and the capital letter O (actually a capital omicron at the time) as a symbol for the "order of complexity". So named because of the convention of writing "Order of Complexity".

##### Time Complexity
    This is the time it takes an algorithm to run
    - Constant Time O(1)
    - Logarithm O(Logn)
    - Linear O(n)
    - Quadratic O(n^2)
    - Exponential O(k^n)
##### Space Compelxity
    This is the amount amount of memory required for algorithm to run
